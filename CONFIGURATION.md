# Kunja Configuration

Kunja stores its runtime configuration under the operating system’s
configuration directory, usually `~/.config/kunja/`. This directory hosts:

- `config.yaml` – authentication settings written by `kunja login`
- `kunja-mcp.log` – optional MCP server log (unless overridden with
  `--log`)
- `cmd.history` – REPL history generated by `kunja repl`

## Legacy location

Earlier versions stored `config.yaml` in `~/.kunja/`. The current release
copies that file into `~/.config/kunja/` on first run so existing tokens
continue to work. After verifying the new file is present, you can delete
the legacy directory.
